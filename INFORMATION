Due to the amazing results of the 2016 iGEM competition, winning the Best Model award in the undergrad catagory
this repository will contain all functions and files used by our team in as clean, neat and organised a fashion
as possible.

I would like to ask you to be patient as we will be rewriting much of the code to try and make it
as readable and understanderable as possible so files will only be uploaded once they are finalised.

If you are reading this and there is a file not yet complete information from our wiki:
http://2016.igem.org/Team:Manchester/Model
Should be able to help you understand the concepts yourself so you can attempt to write the code yourself.

In fact I would emphasise that our code would be better used as a tool for understanding and learning the Ensemble
Modelling methodology and practices and understanding the concept along with applying it will lead to a much more
useful model and analysis than jsut blindly copying it.
